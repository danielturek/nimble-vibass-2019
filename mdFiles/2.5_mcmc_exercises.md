# Exercises

 - Run an MCMC on your own model.
 - Try modifying the scale or propCov arguments to the cross-level sampler (see how we did this for the standard block sampler) and see if that eliminates the initial stickiness of the sampler.
 - Play with different initializations of the scale or propCov for the block samplers.
 - Run one or more of the MCMC variants with multiple chains and judge convergence based on the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic or other diagnostics you like.
