# Automating MCMC comparisons

- A closely related package, `compareMCMCs`, provides tools to automatically compare MCMC efficiency
across methods.
- Methods can include different NIMBLE MCMC configurations as well as
  JAGS
- Later versions of `compareMCMCs` will also support OpenBUGS, WinBUGS, and Stan.

#### Installing `compareMCMCs` package


```r
library(devtools)

devtools::install_github("nimble-dev/compareMCMCs", subdir = "compareMCMCs")
```

#### Overview of `compareMCMCs` package

An introductory overview of using the `compareMCMCs` package is available at:

[https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/nimble-dev/compareMCMCs/blob/master/UserManual/compareMCMCs.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/nimble-dev/compareMCMCs/blob/master/UserManual/compareMCMCs.html).


# Example: Metropolis-Hastings vs slice sampling. NIMBLE vs. JAGS.

 - `compareMCMCs` provides the `doMCMCs` function for comparing different NIMBLE MCMC algorithms, and also JAGS.
 - A variety of pre-defined NIMBLE MCMC configurations are provided, and also a system for defining your own.
    - `nimble_slice`
    - `nimble_noConj`
    - `nimble_RW`
    - `autoBlock`
 - I will illustrate using slice samplers instead of the default
Metropolis-Hastings samplers for `a` and `b` in the litters model, and also comparison with JAGS



# Using `doMCMCs()`

Here's how we set things up to provide a customized MCMC configuration as one of the comparisons.


```r
littersInfo <- list(code = littersCode,
                   constants = littersConsts,
                   data = littersData, inits = littersInits)
```

### Running `doMCMCs()`


```r
littersComparisons <- doMCMCs(
    littersInfo,
    MCMCs = c("jags", "nimble", "nimble_slice"),
    nimbleMCMCdefs = list(nimble_slice =
        function(model) {
            configureMCMC(model, onlySlice = TRUE)
        }),
    MCMCinfo = list(niter = 10000,
                    burnin = 1000))
```



# Viewing the comparisons


```r
make_MCMC_comparison_pages(littersComparisons,
                           dir = "litters_comparison_results",
                           modelName = "littersComparisons")
```

The results are [here](litters_comparison_results/littersComparisons.html).
