# Exercises

1) Write a user-defined sampler that modifies NIMBLE's default Metropolis (*sampler_RW()*) sampler to use a gamma proposal distribution and includes the ratio of the proposal distributions (the Hastings adjustment) for a non-symmetric proposal distribution. Have your proposal centered on the mean of the gamma distribution. (Unfortunately, while you can use the {mean, sd} parameterization of a gamma in BUGS code, you cannot do so in nimbleFunction run code, so you'll need to work around that.

2) Write a user-defined sampler that operates only on the categorical distribution. You could have it be an independence sampler with fixed probabilities of proposing each of the values or a sampler that puts a fixed amount of mass on the current value and distributes the remainder such that the probabilities decays as the difference from the current value increases.
