# The BUGS language

The BUGS language is described in detail in the <a href="http://r-nimble.org/manuals/NimbleUserManual.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: blue">NIMBLE User Manual</a>, and in the <a href="http://www.openbugs.net/Manuals/ModelSpecification.html" target="_blank" style="color: blue">relevant section of the BUGS manual</a>. 

### Stochastic declarations

  - `x ~ dgamma(shape, scale)` (`x` follows a gamma distribution with parameters `shape` and `scale`)

### Deterministic declarations

  - `y <- 2 * x`

### For loops

```
for(i in 1:10) {
   lambda[i] <- exp(mu[i])
   y[i] ~ dpois(lambda[i])
}
```

# Classic BUGS examples

There are lots of example models originally provided by the BUGS project:

  - Included in NIMBLE (*classic-bugs* directory) or found here on the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/Examples/" target="_blank" style="color: blue">JAGS website</a>.
  - Information provided here: <a href="http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/WinBUGS_Vol1.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: blue">Volume 1</a>, <a href="http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/WinBUGS_Vol2.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: blue">Volume 2</a>, and <a href="http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/WinBUGS_Vol3.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: blue">Volume 3</a> of the WinBUGS example manuals.

We'll see a variety of example models later today.

# NIMBLE's dialect of BUGS

   - The BUGS syntax used in NIMBLE has minor differences from that used in WinBUGS, OpenBUGS and/or JAGS. We'll see some of this as we go along, in particular in the <a href="3.1_nimble_bugs_slides.html" target="_blank" style="color: blue">module on NIMBLE's dialect of BUGS</a>.
   - Also described in Section 5 of the <a href="https://r-nimble.org/manuals/NimbleUserManual.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: blue">NIMBLE Users Manual</a> and in this <a href="https://r-nimble.org/quick-guide-for-converting-from-jags-or-bugs-to-nimble" target="_blank" style="color: blue">blog post</a>.

# A basic example


We'll use the *litters* model example from the original BUGS examples, available with NIMBLE in the *classic-bugs/vol1/litters* directory of the installed package (call ```searchpaths()``` after loading the NIMBLE package to find where this directory is). The data set describes the survival rates of rat pups in an experiment.

<center><img src="littersDAG.jpg"></center>

Here's the original litters model.

 - There are ```G=2``` groups of rat litters, with ```N=16```  litters (i.e., mothers) in each group, and a variable number of pups in each litter.
 - Survival of the pups in a litter is governed by a survival probability for each litter, ```p[i,j]```.
 - The probabilities for the litters within a group are considered to come from a common distribution, thereby borrowing strength across the litters in a group.
 - The common distributions are $p_{1,j} \sim \mbox{Beta(a_1, b_1)}$ for group 1 and $p_{2,j} \sim \mbox{Beta(a_2, b_2)}$ for group 2.

# Specifying the BUGS code for a model

Here we specify the litters model code directly in R. We can walk through some of details via the comments in the BUGS code.

```{r, model-code}
library(nimble)
littersCode <- nimbleCode({
  for (i in 1:G) {
     for (j in 1:N) {
        # likelihood (data model)
        r[i,j] ~ dbin(p[i,j], n[i,j])
        # latent process (random effects)
        p[i,j] ~ dbeta(a[i], b[i]) 
     }
     # prior for hyperparameters
     # such gamma priors are not generally recommended, but
     # these are the priors from the original example
     a[i] ~ dgamma(1, .001)
     b[i] ~ dgamma(1, .001)
   }
})
```
