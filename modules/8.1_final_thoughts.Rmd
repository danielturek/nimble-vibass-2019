# Getting help with and contributing to NIMBLE

**We have post-doc funding!**

**We have funding to bring selected users to Berkeley for intensive collaboration.**

 - Announcements: <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nimble-announce" target="_blank" style="color: blue">nimble-announce Google site</a>
 - User	support/discussion: <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nimble-users" target="_blank" style="color: blue">nimble-users Google site</a>
 - Write an algorithm using NIMBLE!	
 - Help	with development of NIMBLE: email $\text{\LARGE{nimble.stats@gmail.com}}$ or see <a href="https://github.com/nimble-dev/nimble" target="_blank" style="color: blue">github.com/nimble-dev</a>

We try to be responsive on the the user support/discussion list, and heartily welcome others to contribute answers as well. 

# Future and ongoing work in NIMBLE

  - Continued development of Bayesian nonparametrics
  - Automatic derivatives (coming very soon):
    - Better samplers
    - Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
    - Laplace approximation and quadrature
    - Maximum likelihood
  - Improved scalability (in progress)
    - Faster model and algorithm building and compilation
    - Particularly for models with many exchangeable nodes
    - Parallelization in the DSL
    - Improved linear algebra (including sparse matrices)
  - Improved workflow (in progress)
    - Saving and re-loading work
    - More flexible DSL syntax
    - Better DSL error trapping/messages

# Big-picture goals

  - improving reproducibility of research that uses hierarchical models and of methods research for hierarchical models
  - enabling easier comparison of methods
