# Exercises

 - Run an MCMC for the stick-breaking version of the AFT model on the myeloma data. Verify that conjugacy is detected for the beta-distributed parameters of the stick-breaking representation.
 - Set up both the CRP and stick-breaking representations for the Faithful dataset in R.
     - Run MCMCs for both. 
     - In general, the number of components will be much less than $n$. Try allowing only $m << n$ components in the dCRP representation and see if seems to work as well. This should give a major speedup in computational time.
 - If you have a model in which a non-parametric density might be of interest, try to start coding up the BUGS code for it.
