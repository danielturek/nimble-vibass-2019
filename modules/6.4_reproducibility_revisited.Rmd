# Sequential Monte Carlo and MCMC

MCMC and SMC are (currently) the two primary families of algorithms in NIMBLE. Why have a platform that supports multiple algorithm families?

 - Users can specify a model and then try multiple algorithms on their models.
 - The algorithms use common computational motifs - e.g., proposing values, computing model density values, storing samples - so can be supported by similar language constructs.
 - Hybrid (composable) algorithms can use computations from both:
     - particle MCMC embeds SMC within NIMBLE's MCMC engine.
     - other methods (not in NIMBLE) use MCMC computations within SMC and could be built in NIMBLE.

# Algorithm composability

As noted, NIMBLE allows one to nest nimbleFunctions, so one can compose algorithms by using your own or NIMBLE's built-in algorithms within the context of the algorithm you are constructing.

E.g., no need to build an entire MCMC engine if you need a bit of MCMC within a different algorithm

Reproducibility goals:

  - reduce code duplication / algorithm reimplementation
  - enable easier construction of composable algorithms via modularity
